**Minecraft Mod Installer**

This script allows you to easily install Minecraft mods either through an executable (`.exe`) or Python script. Choose the method that best suits your needs.

### Executable (`.exe`) Installation

1. **Download and Extract ExeInstaller.zip**: 
   - Download the ExeInstaller.zip file.
   - Extract the contents of ExeInstaller.zip to a folder on your computer.

2. **Ensure all Files are Extracted**: 
   - Make sure to extract all files from ExeInstaller.zip, including the `_internal` folder. It's crucial for the executable to function properly.

3. **Install Forge (if not already installed)**:
   - Forge is required to run Minecraft mods. You can download the Forge installer from [here](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9/forge-1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9-installer.jar).
   - Run the Forge installer and follow the installation instructions to install Forge.

4. **Run the Executable**:
   - Double-click on the executable file (.exe) inside the extracted folder.
   - The executable will automatically install the selected mods.

### Python Script Installation

1. **Install Python**:
   - If you don't have Python installed on your system, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Use pip to install the required packages: os, shutil, requests, and tkinter. You can do this by running:
     ```
     pip install os shutil requests tkinter
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Download the script from the repository.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
   - Run the script by executing it with Python. For example:
     ```
     python script_name.py
     ```
   - The script will prompt you to select mods to install. Follow the instructions to proceed with the installation.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and preferences.
